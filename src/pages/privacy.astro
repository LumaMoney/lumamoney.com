				<h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
				<p>At Luma Money, we take your privacy seriously. This policy outlines our approach to data handling and your privacy rights.</p>

				<h3>Data Collection</h3>
				<p><strong>We don't collect any personal data.</strong> Luma Money is designed with privacy as a core principle. All your financial information stays on your device.</p>

				<h3>Local Storage</h3>
				<p>All data you enter into Luma Money is stored locally on your iOS device. This includes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Transaction records</li>
					<li>Account information</li>
					<li>Categories and budgets</li>
					<li>Any other financial data you input</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>iCloud Backup</h3>
				<p>Pro users can optionally enable iCloud backup to keep their data synced across Apple devices. When enabled, your data is stored in your personal iCloud storage space. We have no access to your iCloud data, and Apple's privacy policy applies.</p>

				<h3>No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
				<p>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We don't know who you are, what you do in the app, or any of your financial information.</p>

				<h3>No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
				<p>Since we don't collect your data, we have nothing to share with third parties. Your information is yours alone.</p>

				<h3>Data Security</h3>
				<p>While we don't have access to your data, we recommend:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Using a strong device passcode</li>
					<li>Enabling Face ID or Touch ID</li>
					<li>Keeping your iOS device updated</li>
					<li>Using a secure iCloud password if you enable backup</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
				<p>Luma Money does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

				<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
				<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Please check this page periodically for any changes.</p>
